Likes to write down my views and emotions in the form of poems and articles. The world of literature always takes me to my own world of imagination, either through writing or reading.","1.""A Live"" Day

Even light of the night is passed
I barely enjoyed it
But now I miss it.

Silence of voilence is passed
Now it's void everywhere
Even with the children.

The innocence is gone
Now they know the world
The bloody one itself.

The earth could still feel the warmth
The warmth of blood
Even the earth feels like crying, but it can't.

They are running
Running with their life in hands
To either trauma or death.

2. Brain Speaks 

The presence is expected
But the absence is noticed
Now I like to be noticed.

Vibrance is beautiful
But dullness suits me
Today, take me slothful.

Caring is kind
But I prefer to ignore 
And return what I receive.

Alive is life
Being dead is my preference 
And it's the trend now.

3. New Age

Stories are disparate
Written and unwritten
Spoken and unspoken
Kind and aggressive
Sad and blissful.
