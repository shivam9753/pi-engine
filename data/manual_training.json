He taught me that Northern plains \nare fertile, and if we sow well, we reap well. \nOn a Sunday morning on the Malabar coast\nI held his forefinger, with my palm\nfinding doodles of a safe space.\nHe loved the breeze kissing my cheek,\nin the heat of the sun, walking on the \ngolden-brown particles of sand, and raising \nmountains of sand with all his fingers waging \nwar against each other. On a rainy day, he’d \nask me to look at the sky at night, and watch the\ndroplets fall on my face, he said rain drops were like \ngod-gifted crystals falling from heaven\nblessing our eyes with a vision worthy of compliments. \nI have always liked men with long eyelashes, \nclean shaved beards, operating drill machines \nand microwaves alike, like my father wanted me to learn. \nHe knew I was inspired by women dying for freedom, \nso he left stories in a mason jar of a world where women laughed \nin the letters they wrote, and smiled when their lover returned with \njhumke for them. \nAs a child my father wanted to catch stars, so he could wear them\non his chest to hear the sound of his own giggles. \nMy father believes borders of countries are blankets spread across the \nworld garnering snippets of heritage he dreamt to make a collage\nout of. At the dinner table on nights when my lips are tired\nof humming prayers for the dead, the needy, the brutal, \nthe wise alike, he hands me another story of a woman whose \neyes glisten of her undying love for me. \nMy father placed the snapshot of my mother on the day\nI bled and became a woman.",

What wasn't however, was a man succumbing to his emotions. \n\n2. As a ten year old, observing kids fall asleep meant persuading  my conscience knowing, a father singing a lullabi to his son is just as beautiful as a mother narrating him a bed time story. What wasn't however, was a father weathering away his parenthood in cheering his son's rebellion. \n\n3. As a fifteen year old, the idea of a 50 something man standing by his abused son, wishing death upon their abuser felt morally fair. What however wasn't, was a father abusing his son to be a man. \n\n4. At 20 now, I see how love resting on the lips of a vulnerable man can never reach his tongue. I see, when a father on his death bed wishes dandelions on his grave, wears agony and is burried with a loathing body, instead. I see how in the end, a fort howling a history of bloodshed and valour, had to surrender to its ruins instead.",

    "notes": "This poem uses vivid, sensory imagery rooted in everyday domestic life—spices, kitchen sounds, cooking processes—to metaphorically explore themes of identity, memory, and aging. The contrast of intimate, tactile details with the closing line “Marinating in my own mediocrity” adds emotional depth and a quiet self-reflection. The free verse style suits the fragmented, contemplative mood well. The poem feels fresh and relatable, with strong literary qualities and effective theme portrayal.",

Its brevity evokes fragility and emotional struggle but leaves some space for deeper development of imagery and complexity. The themes of hope, despair, and grief are handled with subtlety, though the poem could benefit from a richer sensory or metaphorical language to intensify its impact.",
